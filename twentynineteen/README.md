# Advent of Code 2019

This year I am going to try to use Dart, so as to hopefully familiarise myself enough that
trying to learn Flutter isn't *too* much of an issue.

## File Structure

To see a kinda pretty output for each day use `bin/main.dart`. The functionality for each day is found in the appropriate
`lib/day[i].dart`.

## Day 1

This was a relatively straightforward day. It was mostly getting used to reading files in Dart; using async a little bit;
fiddling around with iterators vs lists.
