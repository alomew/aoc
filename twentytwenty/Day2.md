# Day 2

This was a classic good day for Haskell, which was the same another year with a password-related problem: the functions to determine whether passwords are valid are concise, and simple.

But it was my first time using Parsec: here to extract the salient parts from the input. Makes a pleasant departure from having to figure out where everything is in a regular expression match.
